# BFS Lightning Simulator in Svelte

This is a little tool that simulates a lightning strike using a breadth-first-search algorithm. The project is directly inspired by a recent [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akZ8JJ4gGLs), as well as my own motivation to improve my abilities with Svelte and Tailwind CSS.

## Get started

This is a Svelte project. A more detailed set of instructions for making your own can be found [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or for a marginally faster experience, run it in build mode.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
